# garmin2foreflight

Code heavily forked from ([Aleiby](https://github.com/aleiby/kml2g1000)).

Converts the flight activity collected by the Garmin D2 Mach 1 (should also work for the D2 Air X10) GPX tracklogs to G1000 CSV for importing to ForeFlight

## Usage
1. Export the Garmin Flight activity to GPX
2. Run converter.py <gpx_file> python script (requires a python installation and referenced modules)
3. Upload resulting csv files to where you can easily access them on your iDevice (e.g. Google Drive, iCloud)
4. Import into ForeFight on your mobile device from More > Track Logs ([link](https://www.foreflight.com/support/support-center/category/about-foreflight-mobile/360042091114))
